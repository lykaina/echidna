# Echidna
Assembly-like Esoteric Programming Language

### History:
Echidna was originally designed to be run on an Arduino, but memory requirements eventually made this unfeasable, with the Arduino version being shelved.
I then modified the PC version to use far more memory, eventually loading the file into ram and running the program from there.

### Notes:
There are 20 Ops, from G - Z.

Some Ops call up to 20 SubOps as part of their functioning.
