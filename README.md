# Echidna
Assembly-like Esoteric Programming Language

### History:
Echidna was originally designed to be run on an Arduino, but memory requirements eventually made this unfeasable, with the Arduino version being shelved.
I then modified the PC version to use far more memory, eventually loading the file into ram and running the program from there.

### Notes:
There are 20 Ops, from G - Z.

Ops R and S each call up to 20 "Special" Ops, which are hardcoded functions that provide non-essential input and output.
